For this project, 4 files were created. 3 were made using html. The 4th is a cascading style sheet. All content was added to the html pages. One page is the index page located at pswist01@github.io. It includes my name, a picture of me, a link to my resume, and a link to my biography. The second page is my resume which is located at pswist01@github.io/resume. This has sections for my education, relevant coursework, professional experience, skills (languages I can program in), and activities. The third page contains a short biography about me. The CSS file contains 5 rules. They change the color of text and position text on the pages. Git was consistantly used in order to keep logs of each pregressive step. In addition to creating content for these pages, my home page with my tufts CS account located at www.cs.tufts.edu/~pswist01/ was redirected to the index page hosted by github. This project was useful for practice with Git, HTML5, and CSS.
