All parts of the project have successfully been implemented including using a JSON API, using Google Maps, HTML5 geolocation, event handling, and XMLHttpRequest. The distances can be found by clicking my icon. My icon is the cat. I have spent 10 hours working on this assignment. Some commits may not be seen because I messed up and pushed to my public repository. All the files have now been moved off my public repository to my private one.
